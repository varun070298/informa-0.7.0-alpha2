Because there weren't enough XML Data Binding technologies already, I
just wrote one using JDOM. org.jdom.contrib.beans.BeanMapper allows
you to easily (I'd say 'trivially' but that would be taunting the
gods) make a JDOM tree from an existing JavaBean, and/or
instantiate-and-fill one of your JavaBean classes based on a JDOM
tree.  By default it maps element names and property names directly,
but you can override that by setting mappings; e.g. getFoo() could map
to <foo>foovalue</foo> (the default) or <bar>foovalue</bar> or <baz
baf="foovalue">.

Usage:

BeanMapper mapper = new BeanMapper();
// Converting Bean to JDOM Document
doc = mapper.toDocument(mybean);
// Converting JDOM to Bean
TestBean mybean = mapper.toBean(doc);

It uses reflection, so it's not super-fast, but it's meant as a quick
way to get started if you've got a a lot of beans already written and
want to do XML import/export. I seem to have misplaced my CVS
password.  Jools, can you please contact me about checking this in?
In the meantime, anyone who wants to play, please email me privately.

Also, my BeanMapper has support for arrays as property types, and you
can map properties to either elements or attributes.  Attributes must
map to simple properties (ints or strings or other primitives) but
elements can either be mapped to simple properties, or complex ones
(that are themselves beans).

Brett's marshaller/unmarshaller requires elements to be complex and
attributes to be primitive. However, his SchemaMapper kicks major ass.
